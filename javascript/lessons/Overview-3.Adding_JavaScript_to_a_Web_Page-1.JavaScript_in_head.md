## JavaScript in \<head>  

You can place any number of scripts in an HTML document.  
Typically, the script tag is placed in the head of the HTML document:  

>###### |HTML|  
>\<html><br/>
&nbsp; \<head>
&nbsp; &nbsp; **\<script>**<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; **\</script>**
&nbsp; \</head>
&nbsp; \<body>
&nbsp; \</body>
\</html>

There is also a \<noscript> tag. Its content will be shown if the client's browser doesn't support JS script.
