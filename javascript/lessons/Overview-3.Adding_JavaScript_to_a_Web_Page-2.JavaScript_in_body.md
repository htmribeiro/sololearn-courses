## JavaScript in \<body>  

Alternatively, include the JavaScript in the \<body> tag.  

>###### |HTML|  
>\<html><br>
&nbsp; \<head>\</head><br/>
&nbsp; \<body><br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; **\<script>**<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; **\</script>**<br/>
&nbsp; \</body><br/>
\</html>  

:information_source:
It's a good idea to place script at the bottom of the \<body> element.  
This can improve page load, because HTML display is not blocked by scripts loading.  

:question:
Where else is the "script" tag typically placed?  

:white_circle: Inside the table element  
:white_circle: Inside the form element  
:radio_button: Inside the BODY tag
